        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            Today we will be looking at a Reproducibility Pattern:Feature Store Design Pattern.The concept of a "Feature
            Store" in the context of machine learning (ML) refers to a centralized repository for storing, managing, and
            serving features used in the development and deployment of machine learning models.Features are the input
            variables or attributes that models use to make predictions. The Feature Store ML design pattern is a way of
            organizing and handling these features in a systematic and scalable manner.

        <h3>FeatureStore Design Pattern</h3>
        <p><em>The Rationale</em></p>
        <p>Intent of Feature Store Design Pattern is to create centralized location to store and document feature
            datasets that will be used in building machine learning models.
        <p>
            The adoption of a Feature Store can significantly improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and collaboration
            aspects of
            machine learning projects. Different organizations may implement variations of this design pattern based on
            their specific requirements and technological stack.


            <!-- The pattern suggests storing the copy of the object’s state in a special object called memento. The contents
            of the memento aren’t accessible to any other object except the one that produced it. Other objects must
            communicate with mementos using a limited interface which may allow fetching the snapshot’s metadata
            (creation time, the name of the performed operation, etc.), but not the original object’s state contained in
            the snapshot. -->


        </p>
        <p><em>The UML</em></p>
        <p>
            Here is the UML for Feature Store Design Pattern:
        </p>
        <p>+-------------------------------------+
            | FeatureStore |
            +-------------------------------------+
            | - features: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]|
            +-------------------------------------+
            | + add_feature(feature_name: str, |
            | data: Any, |
            | metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]) |
            | + get_feature(feature_name: str) -> Any|
            | + get_feature_version(feature_name: str) -> Optional[int]|
            | + get_feature_metadata(feature_name: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]|
            | + serve_real_time(feature_name: str, input_data: Any)|
            | + serve_batch(feature_name: str, input_data: Dict[str, Any])|
            +-------------------------------------+</p>
        <p>Here are the components of Feature Store Design Pattern</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>FeatureStore is the main class representing the Feature Store.


                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The private attribute features is a dictionary where keys are feature names, and values are
                    dictionaries containing information about the feature, including data, version, and metadata
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Public methods (add_feature, get_feature, get_feature_version, get_feature_metadata, serve_real_time,
                    and serve_batch) represent the functionalities of the Feature Store.
                </p>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <p>The typical flow of the Memento pattern involves the following steps:

            The client (or the originator itself) requests the originator to create a memento object, which encapsulates
            the current state of the originator.
            The memento is passed to the caretaker, which is responsible for keeping track of the mementos.
            Later, if needed, the caretaker can provide a stored memento to the originator to restore its state.
            The Memento pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to implement features like undo
            mechanisms, versioning systems, or any situation where you want to be able to restore an object to a
            previous state without exposing its internal details. It promotes encapsulation by separating the concerns
            of maintaining state and performing operations on that state.





        </p>
        <p><em>Code Example</em></p>
        <p>The FeatureStore class represents a simple in-memory Feature Store.
            The add_feature method adds a new feature to the store or updates an existing one, incrementing the version.
            The get_feature method retrieves a feature from the store.
            The get_feature_version method retrieves the version of a feature.
            This is a basic illustration and does not cover aspects like data persistence, scalability, or integration
            with machine learning pipelines. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a database, version control,
            and integration tools to implement a more robust and scalable Feature Store.

        <p><em>Common Usage</em></p>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Undo Mechanisms:

                        One of the primary use cases for the Memento pattern is in implementing undo and redo
                        functionalities. Each time a user performs an action, a memento capturing the current state of
                        the object is created and stored. If the user decides to undo an action, the object's state is
                        restored from the previous memento.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Snapshotting:

                        The Memento pattern is useful for creating snapshots or checkpoints of an object's state. This
                        is valuable in scenarios such as game development, where you might want to save the state of the
                        game at certain points.

                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>IDEs:The Feature Store Design Pattern is clearly heavily used in any IDEs, as can be seen when
                        you
                        constantly use CTRL+ Z, to undo mistakes you have made either intentionally or unintentionally
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Transactional Systems:

                        In systems that support transactions, the Memento pattern can be used to implement rollback
                        mechanisms. Before committing a transaction, a memento can be created to capture the current
                        state. If the transaction fails, the state can be reverted to the captured memento

                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <p><em>Code Problem</em></p>
        <p>In this extended example:

            The add_feature method now allows the addition of metadata along with the feature data.
            The get_feature_metadata method retrieves the metadata associated with a feature.
            The serve_real_time method simulates real-time serving by using the latest version of the feature for
            prediction.
            The serve_batch method simulates batch serving, allowing users to specify the version of the feature they
            want to use for prediction.
            This example still uses an in-memory data structure, but in a real-world scenario, you would replace this
            with a database or another storage solution. Additionally, the serving methods would typically involve using
            machine learning models for predictions based on the provided features.</p>
